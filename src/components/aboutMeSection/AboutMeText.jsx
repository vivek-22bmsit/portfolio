      <p>
        I'm a passionate and detail-oriented Junior Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building responsive and dynamic web applications using modern technologies. I specialize in crafting user-friendly frontends with HTML, CSS, React.js, and Bootstrap, and developing robust backend solutions using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

        During my internship at Zidio Development, I worked on real-world MERN stack projects that enhanced my skills in full-stack development and problem-solving.

        I enjoy transforming ideas into interactive digital solutions and continuously expanding my knowledge in web development. Iâ€™m actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and build impactful products as part of a collaborative team.
